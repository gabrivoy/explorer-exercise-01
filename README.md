# Explorer Challenge

This repository contains the codes that were used to solve the first exercise on Rocketseat's Explorer (FullStack) developer track. More information on Explorer's course can be found [here](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/formacao/fullstack).

This exercise refers to the module 01 - Introduction to HTML and CSS and is the first mandatory exercise.

## The challenge

This is an introductory challenge to the course. It consists in refactoring a broken code that was given for a page. The code was a simple `HTML` and `CSS` page following a given figma layout. The image below shows how the layout should look before and after the refactoring:

## The solution

To ensure that the code was refactored correctly, the first commit to this repository contains the broken code. The following commits add my progress on the refactoring adding this `README.md` file, and each adjustment made to the code. I've tried to keep the commits as much atomic as possible, so that it is easier to follow the changes, trying to make each commit solve a single problem.
